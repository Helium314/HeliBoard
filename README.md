# SociaKeyboard
SociaKeyboard is a privacy-conscious and customizable open-source keyboard, based on AOSP / OpenBoard.
Does not use internet permission, and thus is 100% offline.

## Reporting Issues

Whether you encountered a bug, or want to see a new feature in SociaKeyboard, you can contribute to the project by opening a new issue [here](https://github.com/Helium314/SociaKeyboard/issues). Your help is always welcome!

Before opening a new issue, be sure to check the following:
 - **Does the issue already exist?** Make sure a similar issue has not been reported by browsing [existing issues](https://github.com/Helium314/SociaKeyboard/issues?q=). Please search open and closed issues.
 - **Is the issue still relevant?** Make sure your issue is not already fixed in the latest version of SociaKeyboard.
 - **Is it a single topic?** If you want to suggest multiple things, open multiple issues.
 - **Did you use the issue template?** It is important to make life of our kind contributors easier by avoiding issues that miss key information to their resolution.
Note that issues that that ignore part of the issue template will likely get treated with very low priority, as often they are needlessly hard to read or understand (e.g. huge screenshots, not providing a proper description, or addressing multiple topics). Blatant violation of the guidelines may result in the issue getting closed.

If you're interested, you can read the following useful text about effective bug reporting (a bit longer read): https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html

## Translations
Translations can be added using [Weblate](https://translate.codeberg.org/projects/sociakeyboard/). You will need an account to update translations and add languages. Add the language you want to translate to in Languages -> Manage translated languages in the top menu bar.
Updating translations in a PR will not be accepted, as it may cause conflicts with Weblate translations.

Some notes on translations
* when translating metadata, translating the changelogs is rather useless. It's available as it was requested by translators.
* the `hidden_features_message` is horrible to translate with Weblate, and serves little benefit as it's just a copy of what's already in the wiki: https://github.com/Helium314/SociaKeyboard/wiki/Hidden-functionality. It's been made available in the app on user request/contribution.

## To Community
You can share your themes, layouts and dictionaries with other people:
* Themes can be saved and loaded using the menu on top-right in the _adjust colors_ screen
  * You can share custom colors in a separate [discussion section](https://github.com/Helium314/SociaKeyboard/discussions/categories/custom-colors)
* Custom keyboard layouts are text files whose content you can edit, copy and share
  * this applies to main keyboard layouts and to special layouts adjustable in advanced settings
  * see [layouts.md](layouts.md) for details
  * You can share custom layouts in a separate [discussion section](https://github.com/Helium314/SociaKeyboard/discussions/categories/custom-layout)
* Creating dictionaries is a little more work
  * first you will need a wordlist, as described [here](https://codeberg.org/Helium314/aosp-dictionaries/src/branch/main/wordlists/sample.combined) and in the repository readme
  * the you need to compile the dictionary using [external tools](https://github.com/remi0s/aosp-dictionary-tools)
  * the resulting file (and ideally the wordlist too) can be shared with other users
  * note that there will not be any further dictionaries added to this app, but you can add dictionaries to the [dictionaries repository](https://codeberg.org/Helium314/aosp-dictionaries)
