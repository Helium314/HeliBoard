## Issue reporting

Whether you encountered a bug, or want to see a new feature in OpenBoard, you can contribute to the project by opening a new issue [here](https://github.com/openboard-team/openboard/issues). Your help is always welcomed !

Before opening a new issue, be sure to check the following :
 - **Does the issue already exist ?** Make sure a similar issue has not been reported by browsing [existing issues](https://github.com/openboard-team/openboard/issues).
 - **Is the issue still relevant ?** Make sure your issue is not already fixed in the latest version of OpenBoard.
 - **Did you use the issue template ?** It is important to make life of our kind contributors easier by avoiding  issues that miss key informations to their resolution.

*Please avoid opening issues to ask for a release date, for PR reviews/merges, for more activity on the project, or worth for more contributors. If you have any interrogations on these topics, read [this comment](https://github.com/openboard-team/openboard/issues/619#issuecomment-1179534276) from issue [#619](https://github.com/openboard-team/openboard/issues/619).*

## Translation
You can help in translating OpenBoard in your language through our [Weblate project](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/openboard/).

[![Translation status](https://hosted.weblate.org/widgets/openboard/-/openboard/287x66-grey.png)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/openboard/)

## Dictionary creation
To create or update a dictionary for your language, you can use [this tool](https://github.com/remi0s/aosp-dictionary-tools). You will need a wordlist, as described [here](dictionaries/sample.combined). The output .dict file must be put in [res/raw](app/src/main/res/raw), and its wordlist in [dictionaries](/dictionaries).

For your dictionary to be merged into OpenBoard, **you must provide the wordlist you used**, as well as its license if any.

## Code contribution

### Getting started

OpenBoard project is based on Gradle and Android Gradle Plugin. To get started, you'll just need to install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), and import project 'from Version Control / Git / Github' by providing this git repository [URL](https://github.com/openboard-team/openboard) (or git SSH [URL](git@github.com:openboard-team/openboard.git)).

Once everything got setted up correctly, you're ready to go !

### Guidelines

OpenBoard is a complex application, when contributing, you must take a step back and make sure your contribution :
- **Uses already in-place mechanism and take advantage of them**. In other terms, does not reinvent the wheel or uses shortcuts that could alter the consistency of the existing code.
- **Has the lowest footprint possible**. OpenBoard code has been written by android experts (AOSP/Google engineers). It has been tested and runned on millions of devices. Thus, **existing code will always be safer than new code**. The less we alter existing code, the more OpenBoard will stay stable. Especially in the input logic scope.
- **Does not bring any non-free code or proprietary binary blobs**. This also applies to code/binaries with unknown licenses. Make sure you do not introduce any closed-source library from Google.
- **Complies with the user privacy principle OpenBoard follows**. 

In addition to previous elements, OpenBoard must stick to [F-Droid inclusion guidelines](https://f-droid.org/docs/Inclusion_Policy/).

### Current TODO list
In no particular order, here is the non-exhaustive list of known wanted features :
- [x] ~~Updated emoji support~~
- [ ] MaterialYou ([M3](https://m3.material.io/)) support
- [x] ~~One-handed mode feature~~
- [ ] Android [autofill](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/text/ime-autofill) support
- [x] ~~Clipboard history feature~~
- [ ] Text navigation/selection panel
- [ ] Multi-locale typing
- [ ] Emoji search
- [ ] Emoji variant saving
- [ ] Glide typing

### Tooling

#### Edit keyboards content
Keyboards content is often a complex concatenation of data from global to specific locales. For example, additional keys of a given key, also known as 'more keys' in code, are determined by concatenating infos from : common additional keys for a layout (eg. numbers), global locale (eg. common symbols) and specific locale (eg. accents or specific letters).

To edit these infos, you'll need to generate the [KeyboardTextsTable.java](app/src/main/java/org/dslul/openboard/inputmethod/keyboard/internal/KeyboardTextsTable.java) file. 
To do so :
1. Make your modifications in [tools/make-keyboard-text/src/main/resources](tools/make-keyboard-text/src/main/resources)/values-YOUR LOCALE.
2. Generate the new version of [KeyboardTextsTable.java](app/src/main/java/org/dslul/openboard/inputmethod/keyboard/internal/KeyboardTextsTable.java) by running Gradle task 'makeText' :
    ```sh
    ./gradlew tools:make-keyboard-text:makeText
    ```
   
#### Update emojis

See make-emoji-keys tool [README](tools/make-emoji-keys/README.md).
