This directory contains dictionaries compiled from sentence lists to make use of next-word predictions.
Currently all word dictionaries are based on word lists available at https://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/en/download/ under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

The emoji dictionary is adapted from [gemoji](https://github.com/github/gemoji/blob/master/db/emoji.json) without further processing.

Dictionaries are created using [`create_wordlist_from_sentences.py`](create_wordlist_from_sentences.py) for `<locale>_wordlist.combined` and [`dicttool_aosp.jar`](https://github.com/remi0s/aosp-dictionary-tools) for creating `.dict` files. See the `example_()` functions in the python script for how to use it. You can simply adjust paths and add your sentence (or word) lists.
The script is still experimental, rather slow and may produce bad dictionaries in some languages. Some words seem to be wrongly added (e.g. "i" for English), and names are typically missing, though this depends on how exactly you create the Android dictionaries.

A "potentially_offensive" attribute is added for some words, which sometimes seems unnecessary. Currently this is coming from the "nosuggest" attribute of the used _hunspell_ dictionaries, which occurs for offensive words as well as for weird / rare word forms.

Other flags are currently missing, same for shortcuts (e.g. ill -> I'll or écoeuré -> écœuré, as found in AOSP dictionaries).

`wordlist.combined` file infos (mostly guessed, didn't find documentation):
* header is necessary
  * format like `dictionary=main:en_us,locale=en_US,description=English (US),date=1414726260,version=54`
  * all of these fields are necessary, though `description` is not used
  * German dictionaries also have `REQUIRES_GERMAN_UMLAUT_PROCESSING=1`
* each word is in a line like ` word=re,f=0,flags=abbreviation,originalFreq=99,possibly_offensive=true`
  * `word` is the word (necessary)
  * `f` is frequency, from 0 to 255(?) (necessary)
    * higher value is more likely to get suggested / corrected
    * special value `whitelist`, possibly equal to 15
    * `f=0` will not be suggested if bad words are blocked, and will never be added to user history
      * possible bug: words with `possibly_offensive=true` and `f=0` will be suggested when not blocking offensive words, but other words with `f=0` are still not suggested
  * `originalFreq`: unclear, is this used?
  * `flags`: `medical`, `technical`, `hand-added`, `babytalk`, `abbreviation`, `offensive`, `technical`, `nonword`, and probably more: are they used for anything?
  * `possibly_offensive=true` stops the word from being suggested when blocking offensive words
  * `not_a_word=true` will not be suggested, use together with `shortcut`
  * `shortcut=<s>` (below a `<word>`) will suggest `<s>` when the `<word>` is typed
    * which `f` to use? maybe only 0-14 and `whitelist` allowed
    * what does `f` do here?
  * `bigram=<b>` (below a `<word>`) will suggest `<b>` as next word before typing any letters
    * what does `f` do here? Looks like 1, 2, and 3 are used for the usual 3 bigram entries
