/**
 * Receives broadcasts pertaining to dictionary management and takes the appropriate action.
 * <p>
 * This object receives three types of broadcasts.
 * - Package installed/added. When a dictionary provider application is added or removed, we
 * need to query the dictionaries.
 * - New dictionary broadcast. The dictionary provider broadcasts new dictionary availability. When
 * this happens, we need to re-query the dictionaries.
 * - Unknown client. If the dictionary provider is in urgent need of data about some client that
 * it does not know, it sends this broadcast. When we receive this, we need to tell the dictionary
 * provider about ourselves. This happens when the settings for the dictionary pack are accessed,
 * but Latin IME never got a chance to register itself.
