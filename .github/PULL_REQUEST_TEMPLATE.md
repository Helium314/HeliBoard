<!--
See the contributing section in the readme for more detailed guideline: https://github.com/Helium314/HeliBoard?tab=readme-ov-file#guidelines
Most importantly:
* The PR should focus on a single contribution.
* Describe briefly what your pull request proposes to fix or improve.
* If it's not completely obvious, describe what the PR does to achieve the desired result.

Further
* If you use someone else's code, please mention or better link to the source.
* When the PR contains "fixes" <issue number>, the related issue will be linked and automatically closed if the PR is merged (also works for other words like "fix", "resolve", "resolves", "closes", ...)
* If you add a layout, make sure you have read https://github.com/Helium314/HeliBoard/blob/main/layouts.md#adding-new-layouts--languages
