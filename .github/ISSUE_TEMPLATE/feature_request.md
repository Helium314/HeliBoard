<!--
Please search open and closed issues to avoid duplicates. Maybe what you want has already been discussed or is mentioned in the readme.
If you have more than one feature request, open multiple issues (one for each) unless the requests are closely related.
Note that given the number of feature requests and available developer time, it may take a long time until the feature request gets attention.
When a "PR" or "contributor needed" label is added, the feature request is accepted, and interested contributors are welcome to work on this (please comment when you're working on an issue).
