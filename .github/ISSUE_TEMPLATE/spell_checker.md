<!--
tl;dr
* search for duplicates also in closed issues
* one issue per topic
* reduce screenshot size

Make sure you actually enabled HeliBoard spell checker. Usually it can be found in System Settings -> System -> Languages -> Advanced -> Spell Checker, but this may depend on Android version.
Note that the menu when tapping a word underlined in red is coming form the Android system and is not under control of HeliBoard.

Please search open and closed issues to avoid duplicates. Maybe what you want has already been discussed or is mentioned in the readme.
Open one issue per topic / request, and do not use this category for bug reports or feature requests.
If you add screenshots, reduce the size or use thumbnails to keep the issue nicely readable.
