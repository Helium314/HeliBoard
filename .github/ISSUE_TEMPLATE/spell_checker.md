Please see the appropriate readme section for issue reporting guidelines: https://github.com/Helium314/HeliBoard?tab=readme-ov-file#reporting-issues
tl;dr:
* search for duplicates, also in closed issues
* a single issue per topic
* reduce screenshot size

Make sure you actually enabled HeliBoard spell checker. Usually it can be found in System Settings -> System -> Languages -> Advanced -> Spell Checker, but this may depend on Android version.
Note that the menu when tapping a word underlined in red is coming form the Android system and is not under control of HeliBoard.
