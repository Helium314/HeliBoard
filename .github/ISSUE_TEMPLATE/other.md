<!--
tl;dr
* search for duplicates also in closed issues
* one issue per topic
* reduce screenshot size

Please search open and closed issues to avoid duplicates. Maybe what you want has already been discussed or is mentioned in the readme.
Open one issue per topic / request, and do not use this category for bug reports or feature requests.

If you add screenshots, reduce the size or use thumbnails to keep the issue nicely readable.
