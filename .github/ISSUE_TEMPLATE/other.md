Please search open and closed issues to avoid duplicates.

Note that this version of OpenBoard is focusing only on a few things. You can add a feature request or open other issues, but at the current stage it could take a long time until things are improved or even until you get a response.

If you add screenshots, reduce the size or use thumbnails to keep the issue nicely readable.
